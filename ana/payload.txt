This advisory is intended to inform the npm ecosystem with details to resolve 
a third-party malware incident that may have impacted your infrastructure if 
you are directly or transitively dependent on the [fsevents] downloaded binary 
executables that contained unintended code due to an expired cloud storage resource 
being reclaimed by a third party. Details The [fsevents npm package] attempts to 
fetch a pre-built binary executable artifact (fse.node) from cloud storage. 
If this fetch fails, fsevents v1.x will attempt to build this artifact directly 
from source. Version 1.x of fsevents has been deprecated for several years and 
as a result the aforementioned cloud storage resource namespace was available 
for registration. A third party, unrelated to the fsevents maintainers, 
subsequently claimed this namespace and in April 2023 this third party started 
serving modified versions of the “fse.node” binary executable artifact to new 
fsevents v1.x users. As of April 27, 2023 the cloud storage resource in 
question has been indefinitely suspended and is no longer serving binaries.
The affected cloud storage pre-fetch was in fsevents version Impact. The impact 
of the modified versions of fse.node appears to be limited to information gathering. 
Note that initial analysis was performed for the modified artifact associated 
with fsevents v1.2.9, which was distributed as fse-v1.2.9-node-v72-darwin-x64.tar.gz 
prior to the cloud storage resource being suspended. For more detailed analysis you 
may compare a decompilation of the v1.x fse.node artifacts on your systems with the 
intended fsevents v1.x source as it exists at 
If you are dependent on the deprecated version of fsevents v1.x, 
the recommended course of action is to upgrade to fsevents v2.x or 
remove the dependency altogether as currently maintained versions of 
Node.js no longer require fsevents for file system watching on macOS.
